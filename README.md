# Subtractor
Python module for basic subtraction of numbers - created for demonstration purposes as part of a talk at the IPPP Computing Club 22/02/22.

Material presented is available in `SLIDES.pdf`.

## Updates Following Presentation
- Moved original `diff_calc.py` to `src/old_code`.
- Updated `src/subtractor/diff_calc.py` with the modifications outlined in the presentation such that the CI pipeline passes (the pipeline was intentionally set to fail previously for demonstration purposes during the presentation).
